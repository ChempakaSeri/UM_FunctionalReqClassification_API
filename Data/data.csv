The distillery worked with Microsoft and Fourkind in collaboration to make the first-ever ML-designed complex consumer drink.,1
"This technology is currently advancing at a breakneck pace, much like the exponential growth experienced by database technology in the late twentieth century.",1
" Databases have grown to become the core infrastructure that drives enterprise-level software. Similarly, most of the new value added from software over the coming decades is expected to be driven, at least in part, by AI.",1
researchers have trained computer models to identify an individual’s personality traits more accurately than their friends based exclusively on what Facebook posts they had liked.,1

"business and policy communities are still struggling to wrap their heads around the cyber realm’s newfound importance, the application of AI to cyber security is heralding even greater changes.",1
the essential purposes of AI is to automate tasks that previously would have required human intelligence.,1
" AI could be applied to cyber defence, log lines of recorded activity from servers and network components can be labelled as “hostile” or “non-hostile,” and an AI system can be trained using this data set to classify future observations into one of those two classes.",1
This kind of automated cyber defence is necessary to deal with the overwhelming level of activity that must now be monitored. ,1
"Continuously retraining such AI models is essential, since just as AI is used to prevent attacks, hostile actors of all types are also using AI to recognize patterns and identify the weak points of their potential targets.",1
"AI similar to chatbots could be used to automatically construct personalized messages for large numbers of people using data obtained from their browsing history, emails and tweets ",1
"AI will not only augment existing strategies for offence and defence, but also open new fronts in the battle for cyber security as malicious actors seek ways to exploit the technology’s particular weaknesses",1
"AI uses data to learn, hostile actors could tamper with the data set used to train the AI in order to make it do as they please.",1
"adversarial examples consist of modifying an AI’s input data in a way that would likely be undetectable to a human, but is calculated to cause the AI to misclassify the input in a certain way.",1
"AI technology will alter the cyber security environment in yet another way as its hunger for data changes what kind of information constitutes a useful asset, transforming troves of information that would not previously have been of interest into tempting targets for hostile actors.",1
"AI systems to make use of even innocuous data is giving rise to the tactic of “data hoovering” — harvesting whatever information one can and storing it for future strategic use, even if that use is not well defined at present.",1
"the chief concern regarding data breaches is the potential misuse of financial information, in this case the information could be used to track down suspected spies by examining travel habits, or to track and detain individuals to use them as bargaining chips in other matters.",1
"The Marriott incident shows that relatively ordinary information can now provide a strategic asset in the fields of intelligence and national defence, as AI can wring useful insights out of seemingly disparate sources of information.",1
"Cyber security requires a comprehensive strategy to minimize weakest links; a piecemeal approach to cyber policy will not work. Since the training data that feeds the most important and revolutionary AI technologies is global in scope, gathered from across many different countries, it is clear that governance at the national level alone will not suffice.",1
"Global policy makers have begun turning their attention to the ramifications of widespread AI technology, and its effect on cyber security in particular. ",1
The application of AI technology to pre-existing cyber attack strategies such as spear phishing will both augment their effectiveness and — by circumventing labour constraints — expand the number of actors capable of undertaking them.,1

"A security advisory posted on Bugtraq demonstrates how hackers can compromise customers of T-mobile wireless and Verizon (landline) voicemail boxes. The advisory talks about the use of Caller-ID spoofing the customers number, allowing a bypass of the PIN code since the voicemail thinks that the customer is calling to check their own voicemail. According to Secure Science Corporation, there has been no response from the vendors. Comments have been posted that T-Mobile has optional PIN code protection off by default. Better turn it on. ",0

"A month ago I was introduced to the works of Michel Gondry.  In short, I was amazed and tantalized by his short films and music videos.  Even if you haven't heard of him, you've probably seen his many works in Gap commercials, various music videos, and the recent movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.    Many of his works explode with visual elements that, when taken alone, are simple and mundane.  However, under his masterful guidance, these elements come together to form a highly mesmerizing visual experience.  He never ceases to push visual technologies and challenge our ideas about the visual medium.",0
"The Australian Defence Force must defend and project across an air-sea gap. This requires long range autonomous strike weaponry. The Joint Strike Fighter does not solve this issue and detrimentally places added pressure on Australia's limited force of aerial refuelling assets. The world's defence manufacturers are not creating strike platforms that solve Australian needs. For this reason, Australia needs to look to other nations with similar defence needs. In this case, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all face defending an air-sea gap. Australia should enter a partnership with these nations to create a strike fighter that satisfies the strategic needs of defending an air-sea gap. The benefits of such a partnership will be many.",0
